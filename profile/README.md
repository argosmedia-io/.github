## Introduction

We are building a solution that enables users to host their own image processing API stack. This will allow individuals and businesses to process images quickly and efficiently, without relying on third-party services.

## Technical Approach

We are using a microservices-based architecture, where each component of the image processing stack is separated into its own service. This allows us to update, scale, and maintain each component independently, ensuring high availability and performance.

We are leveraging state-of-the-art technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenCV to build our solution. The API will be built using a modern web framework, such as Flask or Django, and exposed to users through a scalable API gateway.
Features

### Easy setup and deployment
Our solution will be designed to be easy to set up and deploy, with minimal required technical expertise.
    
### Customizable processing pipeline 
Users will be able to configure the processing pipeline to their specific needs, allowing them to add or remove steps as needed.
    
### High performance
By using optimized algorithms and leveraging the power of Kubernetes and Docker, our solution will provide fast and efficient image processing.
    
### Cost-effective
By hosting the image processing stack on their own infrastructure, users can save on costs associated with using third-party services.
