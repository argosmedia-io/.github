## Introduction

We are building a solution that enables users to host their own image processing API stack. This will allow individuals and businesses to process images quickly and efficiently, without relying on third-party services.

## Technical Approach

We are using a microservices-based architecture, where each component of the image processing stack is separated into its own service. This allows us to update, scale, and maintain each component independently, ensuring high availability and performance.

We are leveraging state-of-the-art technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Libvips to build our solution. The API is built using rust and exposed to users through a scalable API gateway.

## Features

- Easy setup and deployment    
- Customizable processing pipeline     
- High performance    
- Cost-effective

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from the community in the form of bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. If you are interested in contributing, please review our contribution guidelines and reach out to us with any questions.

## Conclusion

We are committed to building a high-quality and reliable solution for image processing, and we believe that our approach will provide significant benefits to users over existing solutions. Stay tuned for updates and releases!
